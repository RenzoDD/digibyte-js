# DigiByte JS

**A pure and powerful JavaScript DigiByte library** forked from Bitpay's [Bitcore Lib](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/tree/master/packages/bitcore-lib) library.

## Principles

DigiByte is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature and the speed of the DigiByte network allows for highly resilient software infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement DigiByte apps and services.

## Get Started

```sh
npm install digibyte-js
```

## Building the Browser Bundle

To build a bitcore-lib full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `bitcore-lib.js` and `bitcore-lib.min.js`.

You can also use our pre-generated files, provided for each release along with a PGP signature by one of the project's maintainers. To get them, checkout the [releases](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/packages/bitcore-lib/CHANGELOG.md).

## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib
cd bitcore-lib
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser` or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.

## Security

We're using Bitcore in production, as are many others, but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.
